# Project-Tic-Tac-Toe

Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed with a focus on object-oriented principles, utilizing factories and the module pattern to encapsulate logic and minimize global variables. The game allows two players to compete, and it includes features such as gameboard management, player control, and game flow handling.

Features
Gameboard Management: The gameboard is stored as an array within a Gameboard object.
Player Objects: Players are managed through separate objects, each storing player-specific data.
Game Control: The flow of the game, including turns and win/tie conditions, is managed by a central game control object.
Encapsulation: Logic is encapsulated within factories and modules, reducing global code.
DOM Interaction: The game interacts with the DOM to allow players to place their markers and see the game progress in real-time.
User Interface: Players can input their names, start/restart the game, and view the game results upon completion.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the web application.
CSS: Styling of the game interface.
JavaScript: Core game logic, including object creation, gameboard management, and DOM manipulation.
